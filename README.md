# College-Enterprise-Resource-Planning-System-Project-
Faculty in a college must manage all information regarding students' attendance, exam results, and personal information. These records are kept by saving them in excel sheets and word documents. Teachers occasionally require data for a specific purpose. They are required to submit a weekly attendance report. To date, they have completed more time-consuming tasks. This project proposes a solution for efficiently completing all responsibilities while also saving time and reducing workload by analyzing the problems that faculty face. The main objectives of this project are to assist any department in maintaining and managing personal data as well as to exemplify the project's objectives for the College Information Management System.
